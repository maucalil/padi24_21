# PADI 2024 Game Proposal

## Concept

The game is a top-down shooter, where players control a character moving within an arena, facing continuous waves of enemies. As players defeat enemies, they earn experience points to upgrade their character's stats, being able to choose between offense, defense, or special abilities. As the game progresses, enemies become stronger and more numerous, challenging players to survive as long as possible.

## Goal

The goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible against increasing waves of enemies. Players must upgrade their character's stats using experience points earned from defeating enemies to withstand the growing difficulty. The game ends when the player's character is defeated.
